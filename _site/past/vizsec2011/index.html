Garfinkel is an Associate Professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. His research interests include computer forensics, the emerging field of usability and security, personal information management, privacy, information policy and terrorism. He holds six US patents for his computer-related research and has published dozens of journal and conference papers in security and computer forensics.</p><p>Garfinkel is the author or co-author of fourteen books on computing. He is perhaps best known for his book Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century. Garfinkel's most successful book, Practical UNIX and Internet Security (co-authored with Gene Spafford), has sold more than 250,000 copies and been translated into more than a dozen languages since the first edition was published in 1991.</p><p>Garfinkel is also a journalist and has written more than a thousand articles about science, technology, and technology policy in the popular press since 1983. He started writing about identity theft in 1988. He has won numerous national journalism awards, including the Jesse H. Neal National Business Journalism Award two years in a row for his "Machine shop" series in CSO magazine. Today he mostly writes for Technology Review Magazine and the technologyreview.com website.</p><p>As an entrepreneur, Garfinkel founded five companies between 1989 and 2000. Two of the most successful were Vineyard.NET, which provided Internet service on Martha's Vineyard to more than a thousand customers from 1995 through 2005, and Sandstorm Enterprises, an early developer of commercial computer forensic tools.</p><p>Garfinkel received three Bachelor of Science degrees from MIT in 1987, a Master's of Science in Journalism from Columbia University in 1988, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in 2005.</p><h3>Panel</h3><dl class="paper-list"><dt>Weichao Wang, Lane Harrison, Danny Quist, Jonathan Maletic, Robert Erbacher</dt><dd>"Visual Analytics and Automatic Detection Methods"</dd></dl></section><section id="cfp"><div class="page-header"><h2>Call for Papers</h2></div><p>The International Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) is a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to address the needs of the cyber security community through new and insightful visualization techniques. Co-located this year with the <a href='http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2011/'>Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS)</a>, the 8th VizSec will provide new opportunities for the usability and visualization communities to collaborate and share insights on a broad range of security-related topics. Accepted papers will appear in the <a href='http://portal.acm.org/'>ACM Digital Library</a> as part of the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series.</p><p>Important research problems often lie at the intersection of disparate domains. This year our focus is to explore effective, scalable visual interfaces for security domains, where visualization may provide a distinct benefit, including computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography, privacy, preventing â€œuser assistedâ€ attacks, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, and penetration testing in addition to traditional network security. Human time and attention are precious resources. We are particularly interested in visualization and interaction techniques that effectively capture human analyst insights so that further processing may be handled by machines, freeing the analyst for other tasks. For example, a malware analyst might use a visualization system to analyze a new piece of malicious software and then facilitate generating a signature for future machine processing. When appropriate, research that incorporates multiple data sources, such as network packet captures, firewall rulesets and logs, DNS logs, web server logs, and/or intrusion detection system logs, is particularly desirable.</p><h3>Technical Papers</h3><p>Full paper and panel abstracts offering novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present technique, applications, practical experience, theory, or experiments and evaluations. Papers are encouraged on technologies and methods that have been demonstrated to be useful for improving information systems security and that address lessons from actual application. We encourage papers that report results on visualization techniques and systems in solving all aspects of cyber security problems, including how visualization applies to:</p><ul><li>Situational awareness / understanding</li><li>Incident handling including triage, exploration, correlation, and response</li><li>Computer forensics</li><li>Recording and reporting results of investigation</li><li>Reverse engineering and malware analysis</li><li>Privacy</li><li>Multiple data source analysis</li><li>Analyzing information requirements for computer network defense</li><li>Evaluation / User testing of VizSec systems</li><li>Criteria for assessing the effectiveness of cyber security visualizations (whether from a security goal perspective or a human factors perspective)</li><li>Modeling system and network behavior</li><li>Modeling attacker and defender behavior</li><li>Studying risk and impact of cyber attacks</li><li>Predicting future attacks or targets</li><li>Security metrics and education</li><li>Lessons learned</li></ul><h3>Awards</h3><p>Accepted papers will appear in the <a href='https://dl.acm.org/'>ACM Digital Library</a>. The program committee will select an accepted paper to receive the VizSec 2011 Best Paper award. A key element of the best paper selection process will be whether the results are believed to be repeatable by other scientists based on the algorithms and data provided in the paper.</p></section><section id="committee"><div class="page-header"><h2>Committee</h2></div><dl><dt>General Chair</dt><dd>Greg Conti, US Military Academy at West Point</dd><dt>Program Chair</dt><dd>Tamara Yu, MIT Lincoln Laboratory</dd><dt>Publications Chair</dt><dd>Marc Abbott, US Military Academy at West Point</dd><dt>Publicity Chair</dt><dd>Anita D'Amico, Secure Decisions</dd><dt>Emeritus Chair</dt><dd>John Gerth, Stanford University</dd></dl><h4>Program Committee</h4><ul><li>Richard Bejtlich, General Electric</li><li>David Barrera, Carleton University</li><li>Carter Bullard, QoSient, LLC</li><li>Bill Cheswick, AT&amp;T Research</li><li>Michael Collins, Redjack</li><li>Ron Dilley, Warner Bros.</li><li>David Ebert, Purdue University</li><li>Alex Endert, Virginia Tech</li><li>Rob Erbacher, Utah State University</li><li>Deborah Frincke, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</li><li>Carrie Gates, CA Labs</li><li>John Goodall, Oak Ridge National Laboratory      </li><li>Warren Harrop, Swinburne University of Technology</li><li>Florian Mansmann, University of Konstanz</li><li>Raffael Marty, Loggly</li><li>Jan Monsch, Google</li><li>Stephen North, AT&amp;T</li><li>Danny Quist, Offensive Computing</li><li>Mark Shaneck, Liberty University</li><li>Dennis Schweitzer, United States Air Force Academy      </li><li>Teryl Taylor, University of North Carolina</li><li>Olivier Thonnard, Symantec Research Labs      </li><li>Joanne Treurniet, Defense Research and Development, Canada      </li><li>Seth Webster, MIT Lincoln Laboratory</li><li>Kirsten Whitley, Department of Defense</li><li>Pak Chung Wong, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</li></ul></section><footer><p>last modified on: May 2, 2012</p><p>site designed and maintained by <a href='http://jgoodall.me/'>jgoodall</a> / built with <a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/'>bootstrap</a></p><p>content licensed under <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/'>CC BY 3.0</a></p></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write(unescape('%3Cscript src="/js/libs/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"%3E%3C/script%3E'))
