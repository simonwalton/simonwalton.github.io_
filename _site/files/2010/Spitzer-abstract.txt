Graphical passwords are an alternative to traditional alphanumeric passwords.  Different variations of graphical passwords exist that present the user with various images and interactively have them select, draw, circle, or sketch to specify their password.  The goal of graphical passwords is to provide an easy-to-use method for entering memorable passwords from a large key space that are difficult to crack.  One graphical password scheme is the Cued Click Points, or CCP.  In CCP, the user is presented with an image in which they click on a specific object or area in the image.  Based on the area selected, a different image appears and is similarly clicked on.  The sequence of clicks through different images represents the password.  The goal of this project was to implement CCP using the common user experience of using Google Maps.  A map of the United States is presented with an overlaying grid.  When a grid point is selected, the map zooms in to the selected area with another overlaying grid.  The experience of selecting a sequence of grid points is identical to zooming in to a desired location in Google Maps.  This project implemented a Google Map version of CCP and collected user data on the ease of use and memorability of the approach.
