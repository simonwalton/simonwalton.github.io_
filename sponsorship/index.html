<p>
The IEEE VizSec Symposium is inviting support from industry, academia, and government contributors in security and data visualization.
</p>
<p>
As a supporter, we encourage you to join us at VizSec 2016, colocated with <a href="http://ieeevis.org">VIS 2016</a> this October in Baltimore. Supporters receive several new benefits this year:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Recruitment</strong> — supporters will engage with the talented students and professionals that attend VizSec and VIS 2016, many of whom are actively seeking internships, employment, and collaboration opportunities.</li>
	<li><strong>Exhibition</strong> — many levels of support include dedicated exhibition space for your organization at VIS 2016.</li>
	<li><strong>Registration</strong> — most levels include one or more complimentary registrations for representatives from your organization.</li>
	<li><strong>Exposure</strong> — for all support levels, your organization’s logos will be prominently displayed at all conference events, on the conference web site, and in any conference materials.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Support Options</h3>
<p>
Please see the <a href="/files/2016/vis_prospectus_16.pdf">IEEE VIS Support Prospectus</a> for support options. For more information on becoming a sponsor, reach out to <a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~ltharrison/">Lane Harrison</a> at <a href="mailto:lane@cs.wpi.edu">lane@cs.wpi.edu</a>.

<ul>

	<li>Coffee breaks</li>
